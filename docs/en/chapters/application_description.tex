    \section{Problem solved}
    Very few social media platforms prioritise their users' safety and opinions.
    
    \section{Proposed solution}
    FriendHub focuses on safety and protecting the users' data, making functionalities that can put them in danger, as deactivated by default. There are guides and warnings that can help those who want to enjoy the latest functionalities.

    Using the bug report or feature request features directly from the application, users can present their opinions and needs in a reliable fashion so that they can easily be addressed by the developers.
